348.B0.b2 = engine spinning (inverse of 348.B1.b0)

348.B1.b0 = engine not spinning (inverse of 348.B0.b2)
348.B1.b1 = no obvious pattern except that it's only ever active when engine spinning
348.B1.b3 = follows 3C8.B1.b4
348.B1.b5 = follows 348.B0.b2 but with different timing on hight->low transition
348.B1.b6 = follows 348.B0.b2 with very similar timing
